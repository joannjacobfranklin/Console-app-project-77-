        Console screen is a screen which can show text, numbers etc. 
        We can also make Math calculations, Do many things with words etc. 
        We can also use variables, arrays etc in the console.
        We use the console screen to check if our code is right or if everything is working.
        You can open the colsole screen in visual studio in 2 ways.
        The first way to open the console screen is to click on run on the top of the scrren and
         click on run without debugging then,
         drag the blue line on the bottom of the screen and click on debug console tab on top of it.
        Don't forget to save the work before you open the console.
        The second way is to click on run on top of the screen and click 
        on run without debugging and choose chrome or edge and maximise the screen 
        that came and right click on the screen click on inspect and click on console
         tab on top of the inspect window. Now here you have the console!
        We can display something on the console in javascript using console.log("abc"); 
        If you need to give a variable, then don't give the brackets.
